## Introduction
An interface in C# defines a contract that classes inheriting from it must follow. It specifies **what a class should do**, while the class itself defines **how it should do it**. This allows for secure, modular, and reusable code.

---

## Example Code
Hereâ€™s an example to demonstrate how interfaces work in C#:

```csharp
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Creating instances of classes that implement interfaces
            Rabbit rabbit = new Rabbit();
            rabbit.Flee();

            Hawk hawk = new Hawk();
            hawk.Hunt();

            Fish fish = new Fish();
            fish.Flee();
            fish.Hunt();

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

    // Interface for prey behavior
    interface IPrey
    {
        void Flee();
    }

    // Interface for predator behavior
    interface IPredator
    {
        void Hunt();
    }

    // Class implementing IPrey
    class Rabbit : IPrey
    {
        public void Flee()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The rabbit runs away");
        }
    }

    // Class implementing IPredator
    class Hawk : IPredator
    {
        public void Hunt()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The hawk is hunting");
        }
    }

    // Class implementing both IPrey and IPredator
    class Fish : IPredator, IPrey
    {
        public void Flee()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The fish swims away");
        }

        public void Hunt()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The fish is looking for smaller fish");
        }
    }
}
```

## Key Concepts

### What is an Interface?
An **interface** in C#:
- Defines a set of methods or properties that a class must implement.
- Cannot contain any implementation; only method signatures (i.e., the method name, return type, and parameters).
- Is declared using the `interface` keyword.

Example:
```csharp
interface IPrey
{
    void Flee();
}
```
Classes that implement this interface must provide a definition for the `Flee` method:
```csharp
class Rabbit : IPrey
{
    public void Flee()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The rabbit runs away");
    }
}
```

### Benefits of Using Interfaces
1. **Security:** Forces classes to follow a specific contract, ensuring consistent behavior.
2. **Code Reusability:** Promotes modular and reusable design by separating the definition of behavior from implementation.
3. **Multiple Inheritance:** In C#, a class can implement multiple interfaces, enabling multiple inheritance.
4. **Plug-and-Play:** Classes can be swapped easily as long as they adhere to the same interface.

### Multiple Inheritance with Interfaces
Unlike classes, a class in C# can implement multiple interfaces. This allows for defining complex behaviors without the limitations of single inheritance.

Example:
```csharp
class Fish : IPredator, IPrey
{
    public void Flee()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The fish swims away");
    }

    public void Hunt()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The fish is looking for smaller fish");
    }
}
```
The `Fish` class implements both `IPredator` and `IPrey`, showing how a single class can fulfill multiple roles.

### Expected Output:
```
The rabbit runs away
The hawk is hunting
The fish swims away
The fish is looking for smaller fish
```

## Conclusion
Interfaces in C# are a powerful way to define contracts for classes, enabling modular, reusable, and secure code. They allow classes to implement multiple behaviors and make systems more extensible and maintainable.

Try experimenting by adding more classes or interfaces to better understand their capabilities!
